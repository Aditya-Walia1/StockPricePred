# 🔮 Time Series Forecasting with Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

A hands-on project on time series forecasting using **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**, developed under the guidance of **Dr. P.S. Rana** and in collaboration with **Harmanjot Kaur**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a time series forecasting model using **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing**, which effectively handles **trend**, **seasonality**, and **level** components in data.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- `statsmodels` for Exponential Smoothing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for Visualization
- `pandas`, `numpy` for Data Manipulation

---

## 📈 Key Features

- Implementation of Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
- Support for both **Additive** and **Multiplicative** seasonality
- Automatic tuning of smoothing parameters: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual values
- MAPE and RMSE score for evaluation

---

## ✨ Learnings

- Difference between additive and multiplicative seasonal models
- Role of smoothing parameters and their effect on model accuracy
- Handling seasonality and trend simultaneously
- Evaluating forecast quality using appropriate metrics
- Real-world application of statistical models in forecasting
